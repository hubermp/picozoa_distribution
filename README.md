## Global Distribution, Diversity, and Ecological Niche of Picozoa, a widespread and enigmatic marine protist lineage

#### Picozoa, an enigmatic lineage of heterotrophic picoeukaryotes within the supergroup Archaeplastida, plays a significant role in marine microbial planktonic communities. To enhance our understanding of Picozoa's diversity, distribution, and ecology, we conducted a multi-level analysis using phylogenetic analysis, species distribution modeling, and ecological niche characterization.

We analyze the EukBank amplicon database ( 18S rRNA gene V4) to:

(1)	determine spatial distribution patterns at different levels, from assemblages to OTUs, (2) place the detected OTUs into a proper phylogenetic context, and 
(3) study the ecological niche dynamics at the OTU level.

Overall, this work advances our understanding of uncharted protists' evolutionary dynamics and ecological strategies.
