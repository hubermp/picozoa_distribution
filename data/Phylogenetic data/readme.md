### Data Description
1. RAxML_bipartitions.Picozoan.tree
This file contains the maximum likelihood Picozoa reference tree (RT) constructed using 50 sequences (longer than 1,000 bp) retrieved from the PR2 database (release v. 5.0.1). The tree was built using RAxML v.8.2.12 with the GTRCATI model, considering 1,000 replicate trees for topology and 1,000 trees for bootstrapping. Twelve Cryptophyte sequences from the PR2 database were used as an outgroup.
2. Picozoan_reference_sequences.aln
This file contains the multiple sequence alignment of the Picozoa reference sequences used to construct the RT. The alignment was generated using the MAFFT v.7 software with the G-INS-i strategy.
3. Picozoan-reference_sequences.xlsx
This Excel spreadsheet provides a comprehensive table with the diagnosis of all the Picozoa sequences published in the latest Picozoa tree (Sch√∂n et al. 2021) and the ones retrieved from the PR2 database.
